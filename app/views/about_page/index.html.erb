<h1>About our data</h1>
<%= render "shared/nav" %>
<p>We use db:seed to populate our database with 3 tables: Player, Park and Arena. Every player can play in 3 diferent park and every park has multiple players
that can play on it, this generate a Many to Many relationship.</p>
<p>In order to handle the Many to Many relationship, a table called Arena was created, this table holds the foring keys from Player and park.</p>
<h2>The data generation process.</h2>
<p>Player's table: Faker was used in order to create a table with  100 players, each player has: name, age, email and phone. </p>
<p>Park's table: I've used the data from https://data.winnipeg.ca/Parks/Park-Asset-Inventory/dk7c-zxyd where I was able to filter the parks that has tennis court and then grabbed their name to 
generate the Park's table that has only the park's name. I have decided to use a sample of 60 parks</p>
<p>Arena's table: This table is generated using data from the previous tables. I link each player on the player's table to a randon park, and I have the system do this process 3 times, so each 
player will be linked to 3 diferent parks.</p>
<h2>ERD</h2>
<p>As you can see on the following ERD, each table that were generated by rails via "rails g MODELNAME" has 3 extra columns: id, created_at and updated_at</p>
